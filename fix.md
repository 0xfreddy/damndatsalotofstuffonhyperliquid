on mobile view there are 3 sections: the graph canvas, the section with the tags and the section with the hyperliquid price and TVL. the tags section and the card have some problems with scrolling, the price card is not fully visibile and the scroll locks before the card its visible, the tags cards has also a divider between the hyperEVM title + count projects and the tags and that creates some extra spacing that could be removed





on mobile view on top add a small header, this header will have a small title "lorem lorem" to the left of the header and to the right a toggle, this toggle will toggle the graph view and the list view. by default the list view will be visibile on mobile. the list view will display all the projcets in the graph view show the project as list, the project logo to the left, the project name next to it and to the right the project tag and twitter icon to redirect
