## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The website has been successfully updated with real HyperEVM ecosystem data!

Key improvements:
- Real projects instead of placeholder data
- 24 unique categories with custom gradients
- Each project shows its Twitter link
- Logo support (logos need to be added to /images/logos/)
- Projects can belong to multiple categories
- Better physics for handling 100+ nodes
- Category nodes show project counts

The visualization now represents the actual HyperEVM ecosystem!

**MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Successfully launched the application server
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Application responding with HTTP 200
- ✅ Server auto-opened in user's browser
- ✅ Ready for user testing and preview

The HyperEVM ecosystem visualization is now live and ready for preview!

**NEW MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Successfully added 8 new projects to the ecosystem
- ✅ Added 4 new categories: Research, Aggregator, Privacy, Utility
- ✅ Added gradients and colors for new categories
- ✅ Added 8 new projects (IDs 112-119):
  * Uncoil Hype (Research)
  * dothype (Utility, Infra)
  * Hytrade (Trading)
  * hyperbloom (Aggregator)
  * aura (Trading)
  * hyper_g8 (Trading)
  * Hyperwave (Defi)
  * Silhouette (Trading, Privacy)
- ✅ All projects have logos available in /images/ folder
- ✅ All projects have correct Twitter links
- ✅ Multi-category support maintained (e.g., dothype has Utility + Infra, Silhouette has Trading + Privacy)

The visualization now includes 119 projects across 28 categories!

**ADDITIONAL PROJECTS ADDED**: Successfully added 2 more projects
- ✅ Added project ID 120: **Hypurr Hub** (News) - @HypurrHub
- ✅ Added project ID 121: **Liquid Swap** (Aggregator) - @LiquidLaunchHL
- ✅ Both projects have logos available and correct Twitter links
- ✅ Using existing categories (News and Aggregator)

The ecosystem visualization now includes **121 total projects** across 28 categories!

**LAYOUT IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED**: Successfully restructured side panel layout
- ✅ Split side panel into 2 distinct glass panels
- ✅ **Top Panel**: Node information, project details, and category tags
- ✅ **Bottom Panel**: HYPE price, TVL data, and "Shoot DM" chip
- ✅ Both panels are simultaneously visible and vertically stacked
- ✅ Fixed overlapping issue between tags and price/TVL indicators
- ✅ Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Maintained glassmorphism design consistency

The side panel now provides clear separation between content areas with no overlapping issues!

- ✅ **Visual design**: Green glassmorphism chip with blur effects
- ✅ **Responsive styling**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- ✅ **Auto-positioning**: Flexbox layout with proper spacing
- ✅ **Theme consistency**: Matches existing green accent color (#27ae60)

The hyperEVM title now displays both the name and total project count in an elegant chip format!

## Lessons
- vis.js is easier to implement than D3.js for network graphs
- Glassmorphism effects work best with backdrop-filter blur
- Node data structure should be planned before implementation
- Python's built-in HTTP server is perfect for testing local web projects
- **New**: ForceAtlas2Based physics solver works better for star topology
- **New**: CSS transitions on body element enable smooth gradient changes
- **New**: Group property in vis.js helps categorize nodes effectively
- **New**: For large graphs (100+ nodes), adjust physics parameters for stability
- **New**: Projects with multiple tags create interesting cross-connections
