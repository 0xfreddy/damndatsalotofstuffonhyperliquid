# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Create a simple website with a dynamic graph visualization featuring:
- Interactive network graph on the left side
- Information panel on the right showing node details
- Glassmorphism design aesthetic
- **Updated**: hyperEVM at center with DeFi categories (DEX, DeFi, Lending, Yield, NFT)
- **New Feature**: Background gradient changes when clicking category nodes
- **Real Data**: 110+ actual projects with 24 categories

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Graph visualization library selection (D3.js, vis.js, or cytoscape.js) ✓
2. Implementing glassmorphism CSS effects ✓
3. Creating smooth interactions between graph and info panel ✓
4. Responsive design considerations ✓
5. **New**: Dynamic background gradient changes based on category selection ✓
6. **New**: Handling large-scale graph with 110+ nodes efficiently ✓

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ PROJECT UPDATED WITH REAL DATA

Successfully integrated real HyperEVM ecosystem data:
1. **hyperEVM** as central star-shaped node
2. **24 Category nodes** including:
   - Defi, Dex, Meme, Staking, Trading
   - Infra, Social, Data, Explorer, Analytics
   - GambleFi, Yield, LST, Oracle, Tools
   - Community, AI, NFT, RWA, Mobile
   - Investment, Stablecoin, News, Landing
3. **110+ real projects** with:
   - Project names
   - Twitter links
   - Logo paths
   - Multiple category tags
4. **Dynamic features**:
   - Background gradients for each category
   - Project info with Twitter links
   - Category statistics
   - Smooth animations
5. **Optimizations**:
   - Adjusted physics for large graph
   - Improved clustering
   - Better performance with 100+ nodes

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The website has been successfully updated with real HyperEVM ecosystem data!

Key improvements:
- Real projects instead of placeholder data
- 24 unique categories with custom gradients
- Each project shows its Twitter link
- Logo support (logos need to be added to /images/logos/)
- Projects can belong to multiple categories
- Better physics for handling 100+ nodes
- Category nodes show project counts

The visualization now represents the actual HyperEVM ecosystem!

## Lessons
- vis.js is easier to implement than D3.js for network graphs
- Glassmorphism effects work best with backdrop-filter blur
- Node data structure should be planned before implementation
- Python's built-in HTTP server is perfect for testing local web projects
- **New**: ForceAtlas2Based physics solver works better for star topology
- **New**: CSS transitions on body element enable smooth gradient changes
- **New**: Group property in vis.js helps categorize nodes effectively
- **New**: For large graphs (100+ nodes), adjust physics parameters for stability
- **New**: Projects with multiple tags create interesting cross-connections
