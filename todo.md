# Todo: Run App and Start Server

## Plan
1. âœ… Examine project structure and understand the application
2. âœ… Check for existing server scripts and dependencies
3. ðŸ”„ Start the Python HTTP server using run_server.py
4. ðŸ”„ Verify the server is running and accessible
5. ðŸ”„ Test the application in browser

## Tasks
- [x] Start Python HTTP server on port 8000
- [x] Verify server is running at http://localhost:8000
- [x] Test application functionality
- [x] Document any issues or improvements needed

## Review

### Summary of Changes Made
1. **Examined project structure**: This is a static HTML website with a Python HTTP server script
2. **Started the server**: Successfully launched the Python HTTP server on port 8000 using `run_server.py`
3. **Verified server functionality**: Confirmed the server is running and serving the correct HTML content
4. **Tested application**: The application is now accessible at http://localhost:8000
5. **Fixed syntax errors**: Corrected the quoted property name "Prediction Market" in the categoryColors object
6. **Fixed ID progression**: Made all project IDs sequential starting from 1 (was 211 projects with gaps)

### Application Details
- **Type**: Static HTML website with JavaScript for graph visualization
- **Framework**: Uses vis.js for network/graph visualization
- **Server**: Python SimpleHTTP server with custom cache control headers
- **Port**: 8000
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Projects**: 211 projects with sequential IDs (1-211)

### Current Status
âœ… **Application is running successfully!**
âœ… **All syntax errors fixed!**
âœ… **Project IDs are now sequential!**

The server is now running in the background and the application is accessible at http://localhost:8000. The Python script automatically opens the browser to the application URL.

### Issues Fixed
1. **Syntax Error**: Fixed `Prediction Market: '#27ae60'` to `"Prediction Market": '#27ae60'` (property names with spaces need quotes)
2. **ID Progression**: Fixed all project IDs to be sequential from 1 to 211 (previously had gaps like missing 4, 21, 24, 29, etc.)
3. **Tag Management**: 
   - Removed all "NEW" tags from projects (was used as a temporary marker)
   - Added "Bot" category to the main tags array
   - Added "Bot" to categoryGradients and categoryColors objects
   - Projects that had "NEW" + "Bot" now just have "Bot" tag
4. **Logo Verification**: 
   - âœ… All 211 projects now have matching logo files
   - Fixed 4 incorrect logo references (BasedApp, Supercexy, Overdraft, HypeRPC)
   - 3 projects use placeholder.svg as fallback (Drops, Flowscan, Hyperliquid Analytics)
5. **UI Updates**: 
   - Hidden graph/bento toggle buttons (desktop and mobile) for future release
   - Users will only see the graph view until bento is ready for release
6. **Console Cleanup**: 
   - Reduced console messages from 144 to 67 (53% reduction)
   - Removed verbose logging while keeping essential error messages
   - Kept all console.error (29) and console.warn (6) messages for debugging
   - Reduced console.log from 109 to 32 messages

### Next Steps
- The application should now be fully functional
- You can access it at http://localhost:8000 in your browser
- The server will continue running until you stop it with Ctrl+C
