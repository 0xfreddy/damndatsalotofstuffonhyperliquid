2. **Created size classification system**:
   - Large (15+ projects): Defi (21), Trading (16) - spans 4x2 grid cells
   - Medium (8-14 projects): Dex (12), Tools (10) - spans 3x2 grid cells
   - Small (4-7 projects): Meme, Infra, Dashboard, News, NFT, LST, GambleFi, Data, Bridge - spans 2x1 grid cells
   - Tiny (1-3 projects): All others - spans 1x1 grid cells
3. **Updated CSS grid system**: Changed from 7-column to 12-column grid for better space utilization
4. **Added dynamic sizing classes**: CSS classes that automatically assign appropriate grid spans
5. **Modified JavaScript**: Added function to determine size class based on project count
6. **Optimized project grids**: Different project grid layouts for each size category
7. **Enhanced responsiveness**: Added tablet and mobile breakpoints with appropriate sizing

**Technical details**:
