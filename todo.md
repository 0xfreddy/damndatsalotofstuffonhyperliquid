### Summary of Changes Made

**High-level explanation**: Successfully fixed small screen bento grid issues by implementing multiple responsive breakpoints and optimizing layout for different screen sizes.

**What was done**:
1. **Reduced mobile grid columns**: Changed from 6 to 4 columns for better space utilization
2. **Added responsive breakpoints**:
   - 767px and below: 4 columns, optimized for tablets and phones
   - 480px and below: 3 columns, optimized for small phones
   - 360px and below: 2 columns, optimized for very small screens
3. **Adjusted category sizing**: Modified grid spans to prevent overflow
4. **Optimized project grids**: Reduced minimum widths progressively for smaller screens
5. **Scaled logo and font sizes**: Smaller logos and fonts for better fit
6. **Added overflow protection**: Added `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling

**Technical details**:
- Mobile (≤767px): 4 columns, large/medium categories span 2x2, small/tiny span 1x1
- Small (≤480px): 3 columns, all categories optimized for narrow screens
- Extra small (≤360px): 2 columns, single column layout for very narrow screens
- Progressive logo sizing: 24px → 18px → 16px → 14px
- Progressive font sizing: 9px → 6px → 5px → 4px

**Expected improvements**:
- No more project cutoff on small screens
- Better space utilization across all screen sizes
- Improved readability on mobile devices
- Consistent layout behavior from desktop to small phones
- No horizontal scrolling issues
