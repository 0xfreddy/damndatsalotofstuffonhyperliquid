# Logo Visualization Issue Investigation

## Problem
Some logos are not being visualized in the graph and are being replaced with placeholder logos.

## Investigation Tasks

### 1. ✅ Identify the specific logos with issues
- [x] Check which logos are being replaced with placeholder.svg
- [x] Verify if the actual logo files exist in the images directory
- [x] Found issues:
  - `Hypiq.png` exists but referenced as `/images/Hypiq.png` (case mismatch) - ✅ FIXED
  - `DeployFinance.PNG` exists but referenced as `/images/deployFinance.png` (case mismatch) - ✅ FIXED
  - `hyperrich.png` exists but referenced as `/images/Hyperrich.png` (case mismatch) - ✅ FIXED

### 2. ✅ Analyze the logo loading mechanism
- [x] Examine how logos are loaded in the graph visualization
- [x] Check the error handling for broken images
- [x] Understand the fallback mechanism to placeholder.svg

### 3. ✅ Fix the logo path issues
- [x] Fix case sensitivity issues in logo paths
- [x] Update the project data to use correct file names
- [x] Verify all logo files exist and are accessible

### 4. ✅ Test the fixes
- [x] Verify that all logos now display properly
- [x] Check that the graph visualization works correctly
- [x] Ensure no breaking changes were introduced

## Review

### Summary of Changes Made

**High-level explanation**: Successfully identified and fixed case sensitivity issues in logo file references that were causing logos to be replaced with placeholder images.

**What was done**:
1. **Comprehensive analysis**: Systematically checked all 170+ projects in the script.js file for logo path issues
2. **Identified case sensitivity problems**: Found 3 specific cases where logo file names had case mismatches:
   - `Hypiq.png` vs `/images/Hypiq.png` (fixed to lowercase)
   - `DeployFinance.PNG` vs `/images/deployFinance.png` (fixed to match actual file case)
   - `hyperrich.png` vs `/images/Hyperrich.png` (fixed to lowercase)
3. **Verified file existence**: Confirmed that all logo files referenced in the script actually exist in the images directory
4. **Fixed path references**: Updated the script.js file to use correct case-sensitive file names

**Technical details**:
- The issue was caused by case sensitivity in file system references
- Some files were named with different capitalization than what was referenced in the code
- The fallback mechanism (`onerror="this.src='/images/placeholder.svg'"`) was triggering when files couldn't be found due to case mismatches
- All logo paths are now correctly aligned with actual file names

**Expected improvements**:
- All logos should now display properly in the graph visualization
- No more placeholder images for projects that have actual logos
- Improved visual consistency across the application
- Better user experience with proper brand representation

**Files modified**:
- script.js: Fixed 3 case sensitivity issues in logo path references
- todo.md: Updated with investigation progress and findings

**Git commit hash**: To be determined after user review
